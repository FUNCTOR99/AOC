Advent of Code.  Started as coding practice.  2015 is partially complete.  2020 has 1 of 49 problems pending.

Advent of Code is a yearly coding challenge that starts 25 days before Christmas each year.  Every night at midnight eastern time a new problem drops.  Coders have unique input that needs to generate an expected output.  The speed at which this happens determines how many points the coder receives.

Years implemented:
https://adventofcode.com/2015  (days 1 -> 17 complete)
https://adventofcode.com/2020  (days 1 -> 25 complete)

This repo was created in 2015 as a coding test to do the nightly challenges.  I used SOLID coding principles in a console .Net application that removed much of the redundant tasks.  

For each of the challenges there exists an elegant solution where a simple computer should be able to calculate the solution in just a few moments.  Finding that solution is often very fun and challenging!
