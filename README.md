Advent of Code is a yearly coding challenge that starts 25 days before Christmas.  Every night at midnight eastern time a new problem drops.  Coders have unique input that needs to generate an expected output.  There are no rules on how the solution must be coded.  Any language can be used.  The time it takes to generate the correct response determines how many points the coder receives for that day.


For each of the challenges there exists an elegant solution where a simple computer should be able to calculate the solution in just a few moments.  Finding that solution is often very fun and challenging!

This repo was created in 2015 as a coding test to do the nightly challenges.  I used SOLID coding principles in a console .Net application that removed much of the redundant tasks.  I later used it again in 2020.


In 2020, over 190,000 coders submitted at least one correct answer to the first problem.  Only 14,000 (7%) finished all 25 days.
